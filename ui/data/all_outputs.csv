"Please explain what is ""Kalman filter""","['For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary developers of its theory.\nThis digital filter is sometimes termed the Stratonovich–Kalman–Bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general, nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the Soviet mathematician Ruslan Stratonovich. In fact, some of the special case linear filter\'s equations appeared in  papers by Stratonovich that were published before summer 1960, when Kalman met with Stratonovich during a conference in Moscow.\nKalman filtering has numerous technological applications. A common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly aircraft, spacecraft and ships positioned dynamically. Furthermore, Kalman filtering is a concept much applied in time series analysis used for topics such as signal processing and econometrics. Kalman filtering is also one of the main topics of robotic motion planning and control and can be used for trajectory optimization.[10] Kalman filtering also works for modeling the central nervous system\'s control of movement. Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback, the use of Kalman filters[11] provides a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of a motor system and issuing updated commands.[12]\nThe algorithm works by a two-phase process. For the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.\nOptimality of Kalman filtering assumes that errors have a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  In the words of Rudolf E. Kálmán: ""In summary, the following assumptions are made about random processes: Physical random phenomena may be thought of as due to primary random sources exciting dynamic systems. The primary sources are assumed to be independent gaussian random processes with zero mean; the dynamic systems will be linear.""[13]  Though regardless of Gaussianity, if the process and measurement covariances are known, the Kalman filter is the best possible linear estimator in the minimum mean-square-error sense.[14]\nExtensions and generalizations of the method have also been developed, such as the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The basis is a hidden Markov model such that the state space of the latent variables is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions. Kalman filtering has been used successfully in multi-sensor fusion,[15] and distributed sensor networks to develop distributed or consensus Kalman filtering.[16]']","['The Kalman filter is a mathematical method used to estimate the state of a system from noisy and incomplete observations. It is often used in the fields of engineering, economics, and computer science for tasks such as signal processing, sensor fusion, and state estimation.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter is based on the idea of recursive Bayesian filtering, which involves repeatedly updating the probability distribution over the state of the system based on new observations and process model. It works by combining an initial estimate of the state of the system with additional information from noisy observations to produce a more accurate estimate.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter involves two steps: prediction and correction. In the prediction step, the filter uses a process model to predict the state of the system at the next time step based on the current estimate and any additional control inputs. In the correction step, the filter updates the estimate based on new observations, using a measurement model to relate the observations to the state of the system.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter can be used for both linear and nonlinear systems, and it is often used in applications where the system being modeled is uncertain or the observations are noisy. It is also widely used in control systems, robotics, and navigation, where it can be used to estimate the state of a system and track its position and velocity over time.']","['Historical context', 'Applications', 'Technical details', 'Citation of sources', 'Assumptions and limitations']","['Simplification of concepts', 'Focus on function and steps', 'Relatability to other fields', 'Clarity']"
"Please explain what is ""Visual cortex""","['The visual cortex of the brain is the area of the cerebral cortex that processes visual information. It is located in the occipital lobe.

For example, some areas of the visual cortex are responsible for analyzing the basic features of an image, such as color, shape, and contrast. Other areas are responsible for integrating information from different parts of the visual field and constructing a 3-dimensional representation of the world.\n\n\n\nThe visual cortex receives input from the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye. When light enters the eye, it is detected by the retina and transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve.

"Please explain what is ""Cyber defence""","[""Proactive cyber defence means acting in anticipation to oppose an attack through cyber and cognitive domains. Proactive cyber defence can be understood as options between offensive and defensive measures. It includes interdicting, disrupting or deterring an attack or a threat's preparation to attack, either pre-emptively or in self-defence. Common methods include cyber deception, attribution, threat hunting and adversarial pursuit. The mission of the pre-emptive and proactive operations is to conduct aggressive interception and disruption activities against an adversary using: psychological operations, managed information dissemination, precision targeting, information warfare operations, computer network exploitation, and other active threat reduction measures. The proactive defense strategy is meant to improve information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents and to provide strike options as well as to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battlespace. Proactive cyber defence can be a measure for detecting and obtaining information before a cyber attack, or it can also be impending cyber operation and be determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber counter-operation. \nThe offensive capacity includes the manipulation and/or disruption of networks and systems with the purpose of limiting or eliminating the adversary's operational capability. This capability can be required to guarantee one's freedom of action in the cyber domain. Cyber-attacks can be launched to repel an attack (active defence) or to support the operational action. Proactive cyber defence differs from active defence, meaning that it is pre-emptive (not waiting for an attack to occur). The distinction between active cyber defence and offensive cyber operations (OCO) is that the later requires legislative exceptions to undertake. Hence, offensive cyber capabilities may be developed in collaboration with industry and facilitated by private sector.

Continuous production is called a continuous process or a continuous flow process because the materials, either dry bulk or fluids that are being processed are continuously in motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment.  Continuous processing is contrasted with batch production.\nContinuous usually means operating 24 hours per day, seven days per week with infrequent maintenance shutdowns, such as semi-annual or annual.  Some chemical plants can operate for more than one to two years without a shutdown.  Blast furnaces can run from four to ten years without stopping.']","['Continuous production is a manufacturing process in which products are produced in a continuous and uninterrupted flow.

Instead, raw materials are continuously fed into the production process, and finished products are continuously produced and sent for further processing or packaging.\n\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of continuous production is that it allows for a high level of efficiency and productivity. Since the production process is not stopped or interrupted, there are fewer delays and less time is wasted. Continuous production also allows for the production of large quantities of products in a short amount of time, which can be beneficial in industries where there is a high demand for products.\n\n\n\nThere are several types of continuous production processes, including assembly lines, rolling mills, and extrusion processes.

"Please explain what is ""Ordinary least squares""","['In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) is a type of linear least squares method for choosing the unknown parameters in a linear regression model (with fixed level-one effects of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables) by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the input dataset and the output of the (linear) function of the independent variable.\nGeometrically, this is seen as the sum of the squared distances, parallel to the axis of the dependent variable, between each data point in the set and the corresponding point on the regression surface—the smaller the differences, the better the model fits the data. The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula, especially in the case of a simple linear regression, in which there is a single regressor on the right side of the regression equation.\nThe OLS estimator is consistent for the level-one fixed effects when the regressors are exogenous and forms perfect colinearity (rank condition), consistent for the variance estimate of the residuals when regressors have finite fourth moments  and—by the Gauss–Markov theorem—optimal in the class of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and serially uncorrelated.

"Please explain what is ""Intellectual property""","['Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The best-known types are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.

The term ""intellectual property"" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world\'s legal systems.\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.[10]\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is ""indivisible"", since an unlimited number of people can ""consume"" an intellectual good without its being depleted.[11][page\xa0needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price.

Local search algorithms move from solution to solution in the space of candidate solutions (the search space) by applying local changes, until a solution deemed optimal is found or a time bound is elapsed.\nLocal search algorithms are widely applied to numerous hard computational problems, including problems from computer science (particularly artificial intelligence), mathematics, operations research, engineering, and bioinformatics. Examples of local search algorithms are WalkSAT, the 2-opt algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.']","['Local search is a method of optimization that involves iteratively improving a solution to a problem by making small, local changes to it.

Some common examples include hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms.\n\n\n\nLocal search algorithms are often used to solve optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path between two points or the maximum value of a function. They can also be used to solve constraint satisfaction problems, such as finding a set of values that satisfy a set of given constraints.\n\n\n\nOne of the key benefits of local search algorithms is that they can be applied to a wide range of problems and are relatively easy to implement.

"Please explain what is ""Formal reasoning""","['Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.\nReasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one\'s intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.\nIn contrast to the use of ""reason"" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.\nUsing reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, ""morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one\'s conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.""\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.']","['Formal reasoning is a type of logical argument that follows a specific set of rules and conventions. It is a systematic process that involves making logical inferences based on statements or propositions that are considered to be true or accepted as premises.\n\n\n\nIn formal reasoning, arguments are constructed using deductive or inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning involves starting with a general statement or principle and using it to reach a specific conclusion. Inductive reasoning involves starting with specific observations or examples and using them to reach a general conclusion.\n\n\n\nFormal reasoning is used in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and law. It is an important tool for evaluating and understanding complex systems and for making informed decisions based on logical analysis.']","['Philosophical Context', 'Link to cognitive science', 'Reflects on human activities', 'Encompasses broader reasoning kinds', 'Expresses subtle nuances']","['Clear definitions', 'Simpler language', 'Provides examples', 'More concise', 'Straightforward and didactic']"

"Please explain what is ""Hill climbing""","[""In numerical analysis, hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search. It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.\nFor example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.\nHill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems – for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space). Examples of algorithms that solve convex problems by hill-climbing include the simplex algorithm for linear programming and binary search.:\u200a253\u200a To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).\nThe relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems, so long as a small number of increments typically converges on a good solution (the optimal solution or a close approximation). At the other extreme, bubble sort can be viewed as a hill climbing algorithm (every adjacent element exchange decreases the number of disordered element pairs), yet this approach is far from efficient for even modest N, as the number of exchanges required grows quadratically. \nHill climbing is an anytime algorithm: it can return a valid solution even if it's interrupted at any time before it ends.""]","['Hill climbing is a heuristic search algorithm that is used to find the local maximum or minimum of a function. The algorithm starts at a randomly chosen point on the function and then iteratively moves to a neighboring point that has a higher value, until it reaches a point where no neighboring point has a higher value. This point is then considered to be the local maximum or minimum of the function.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm can be described as follows:\n\n\n\nChoose a starting point on the function.\n\nEvaluate the value of the function at the starting point.\n\nCheck the neighboring points to see if any of them have a higher value than the current point. If so, move to the neighboring point with the highest value.\n\nRepeat step 3 until no neighboring point has a higher value than the current point.\n\nHill climbing is a simple and effective algorithm, but it has some limitations. It can get stuck in local maxima or minima, which are points that are not the global maximum or minimum of the function but are still the highest or lowest point in their immediate vicinity. In addition, the algorithm does not guarantee that it will find the global maximum or minimum of the function, only the local maximum or minimum.']","['Technological context', 'Industry application', 'Algorithm comparison', 'In-depth explanation', 'Global vs local optima explanation', 'More specific examples']","['Algorithm specific steps', 'Simpler format and language', 'Concise and to-the-point information', 'Explicit identification of limitations']"
"Please explain what is ""Artificial neuron""","[""An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function[clarification needed]. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often  monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.\nThe artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function.\nArtificial neurons can also refer to artificial cells in neuromorphic engineering (see below) that are similar to natural physical neurons.""]","['An artificial neuron is a mathematical function that is designed to mimic the behavior of a biological neuron.

"Please explain what is ""Church–Turing thesis""","[""In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the  Turing–Church thesis, the Church–Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:\nChurch, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).\nOn the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.\nSince its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).""]","['The Church-Turing thesis is a fundamental principle in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. It states that any computation that can be performed by a human using pen and paper can also be performed by a machine, as long as it is given the right instructions.

Church was a logician and mathematician who developed the concept of the ""effective calculability"" of functions, which formed the basis for the Church-Turing thesis.

"Please explain what is ""Information mining""","['Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

"Please explain what is ""Formal reasoning""","['Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.\nReasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one\'s intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.\nIn contrast to the use of ""reason"" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.\nUsing reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, ""morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one\'s conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.""\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.']","['Formal reasoning is a type of logical argument that follows a specific set of rules and conventions.

Deductive reasoning involves starting with a general statement or principle and using it to reach a specific conclusion. Inductive reasoning involves starting with specific observations or examples and using them to reach a general conclusion.\n\n\n\nFormal reasoning is used in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and law.

After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.\nLazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate. \nThe opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation. Eager evaluation is the evaluation strategy employed in most[quantify] programming languages.""]","['Lazy evaluation is a strategy used in computer programming to delay the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This approach is often used to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations, and it can also be used to facilitate the creation of infinite data structures.\n\n\n\nIn many programming languages, expressions are evaluated as soon as they are encountered during the execution of a program. However, with lazy evaluation, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until it is actually required. This can be accomplished through the use of special constructs, such as lazy variables or lazy functions, which are evaluated only when they are accessed or called.\n\n\n\nOne common use of lazy evaluation is to improve the performance of a program by avoiding the computation of unnecessary values. For example, if a program needs to perform a computation that involves a large data set, it may be more efficient to use lazy evaluation to compute only the values that are actually needed, rather than computing the entire data set and then discarding the unused values.\n\n\n\nLazy evaluation can also be used to create infinite data structures, such as streams or lists that can be traversed indefinitely. In these cases, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until the next value in the data structure is needed, allowing the data structure to be constructed on the fly as it is traversed.\n\n\n\nOverall, lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the performance and expressiveness of a program by allowing it to compute only the values that are actually needed.']","['Technical terms', 'Combination with other concepts', 'Nuanced drawbacks']","['Simplified language', 'Practical examples', 'Indication of use cases']"

In other words, a random field is said to be a Markov random field if it satisfies Markov properties. The concept originates from the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model.\nA Markov network or MRF is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies[further explanation needed]); on the other hand, it can't represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies[further explanation needed]). The underlying graph of a Markov random field may be finite or infinite.\nWhen the joint probability density of the random variables is strictly positive, it is also referred to as a Gibbs random field, because, according to the Hammersley–Clifford theorem, it can then be represented by a Gibbs measure for an appropriate (locally defined) energy function. The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced as the general setting for the Ising model.

The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. The terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used to specify the nature of the scalars: real coordinate space or complex coordinate space.\nVector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities, such as forces and velocity, that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrix, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.\nVector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is finite-dimensional if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.\nMany vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures.

This purpose is very similar to the proposed purposes for artificial intelligence generally, except that machine perception would only grant machines limited sentience, rather than bestow upon machines full consciousness, self-awareness, and intentionality.']","['Machine perception is the ability of a machine to interpret and understand sensory data from its environment, such as images, sounds, and other inputs.

"Please explain what is ""Array data structure""","['In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.\nFor example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i × 4).\nThe memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.\nBecause the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called ""matrices"". In some cases the term ""vector"" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word ""table"" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\nArrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.\nThe term ""array"" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.\nThe term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or ""abstract array"", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.']","['An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items, typically in a contiguous block of memory. The items in an array are usually of the same data type, and are accessed using an index.\n\n\n\nIn many programming languages, an array is implemented as a fixed-size sequenced collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is assigned a unique index, which is used to identify and access the element. The first element in the array is assigned an index of 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1, and so on.\n\n\n\nHere is an example of how you might declare and initialize an array of integers in C:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nint numbers[5];\n\nnumbers[0] = 10;\n\nnumbers[1] = 20;\n\nnumbers[2] = 30;\n\nnumbers[3] = 40;\n\nnumbers[4] = 50;\n\nIn this example, we have declared an array called numbers that can hold 5 integers. We have then initialized the array by assigning values to each element in the array. We can access the elements of the array using their indexes, like this:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nprintf(""%d"", numbers[0]);  // prints 10\n\nprintf(""%d"", numbers[2]);  // prints 30\n\nArrays are a useful data structure for storing and manipulating large amounts of data, but they have some limitations. For example, the size of an array is fixed when it is created, so you cannot easily add or remove elements from the array. In addition, arrays are not well-suited for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the collection. For these types of operations, you might want to consider using a different data structure such as a linked list.']","['Technical Details', 'Historical Context', 'Complexity of Information', 'Use of Examples']","['Simplicity and Directness', 'Practical Code Example', 'Discussion on Limitations', 'Informal Tone']"

For example, in structure from motion (SfM) or multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms, bundle adjustment is used to refine the estimated positions of the cameras and 3D points in the scene, based on their projections in the images.\n\n\n\nBundle adjustment is an iterative optimization process that involves computing the residual error between the observations and the model predictions, and adjusting the model parameters to minimize this error. The optimization process is typically carried out using techniques such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm or Gauss-Newton algorithm.\n\n\n\nBundle adjustment is a computationally intensive process, and the accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the initial estimates and the amount of available data.

You might use the SUM function in a query to find the total salary of all employees in a company, or the total sales of a particular product.\n\n\n\nOther common aggregate functions include AVG (average), MIN (minimum value), and MAX (maximum value).\n\n\n\nHere is an example of how you might use an aggregate function in a SQL query:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nSELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;\n\nThis query would return the total salary of all employees in the employees table.\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that aggregate functions only work on sets of values, not individual values. So if you tried to use an aggregate function on a single value, you would get an error. For example, the following query would be invalid:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nSELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE id = 1;\n\nThis is because the WHERE clause in the query is limiting the result set to a single row, and the SUM function can only be applied to a set of values, not a single value.

He is one of the most prominent figures in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics. He wrote works on philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history and philology. Leibniz also made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics and computer science. In addition, he contributed to the field of library science: while serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would have served as a guide for many of Europe\'s largest libraries.[17] Leibniz\'s contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German, but also in English, Italian and Dutch.[18][c]\nAs a philosopher, he was one of the greatest representatives of 17th-century rationalism and idealism. As a mathematician, his greatest achievement was the development of the main ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton\'s contemporaneous developments,[20] and mathematicians have consistently favored Leibniz\'s notation as the conventional and more exact expression of calculus.[21][22][23]\nHowever, it was only in the 20th century that Leibniz\'s law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found a consistent mathematical formulation by means of non-standard analysis. He was also a pioneer in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal\'s calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685[24] and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of nearly all digital (electronic, solid-state, discrete logic) computers, including the Von Neumann architecture, which is the standard design paradigm, or ""computer architecture"", followed from the second half of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Leibniz has been called the ""founder of computer science"".[25]\nIn philosophy and theology, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our world is, in a qualified sense, the best possible world that God could have created, a view sometimes lampooned by other thinkers, such as Voltaire in his satirical novella Candide. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great early modern rationalists. His philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and still influences contemporary analytic philosophy, such as its adopted use of the term ""possible world"" to define modal notions.']","['Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a German mathematician, philosopher, and polymath who lived in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

Examples of complex systems are Earth\'s global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex software and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe.\nComplex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are ""complex"" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions.\nThe term complex systems often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system\'s parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to reductionism, which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.\nAs an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of self-organization and critical phenomena from physics, that of spontaneous order from the social sciences, chaos from mathematics, adaptation from biology, and many others. Complex systems is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines, including statistical physics, information theory, nonlinear dynamics, anthropology, computer science, meteorology, sociology, economics, psychology, and biology.']","['A complex system is a system that is made up of a large number of interconnected components, which interact with each other in a non-linear manner.

"Please explain what is ""Test set""","['In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.\nThe model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\nSuccessively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model\'s hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).\nThis simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset\'s error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.\nFinally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).\nDeciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.']","[""A test set is a set of data used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

It is often used to obtain results for ill-posed problems or to prevent overfitting.\nAlthough regularization procedures can be divided in many ways, following delineation is particularly helpful:\nIn explicit regularization, independent of the problem or model, there is always a data term, that corresponds to a likelihood of the measurement and a regularization term that corresponds to a prior. By combining both using Bayesian statistics, one can compute a posterior, that includes both information sources and therefore stabilizes the estimation process. By trading off both objectives, one chooses to be more addictive to the data or to enforce generalization (to prevent overfitting). There is a whole research branch dealing with all possible regularizations. The work flow usually is, that one tries a specific regularization and then figures out the probability density that corresponds to that regularization to justify the choice. It can also be physically motivated by common sense or intuition.\nIn machine learning, the data term corresponds to the training data and the regularization is either the choice of the model or modifications to the algorithm. It is always intended to reduce the generalization error, i.e. the error score with the trained model on the evaluation set and not the training data.\nOne of the earliest uses of regularization is Tikhonov regularization, related to the method of least squares.']","['In mathematics, regularization refers to the process of modifying a mathematical problem or equation in order to make it better-behaved or easier to solve. This is often done in order to avoid certain types of solutions that may be undesirable or undesirable, such as solutions that are not unique or solutions that produce divergent results.\n\n\n\nOne common example of regularization is the addition of a penalty term to an optimization problem. For example, suppose we have a function that we want to optimize, but we know that the solutions to the optimization problem may not be unique or may have undesirable properties. We can add a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes solutions that have these undesirable properties, which helps to steer the optimization towards solutions that are more desirable.\n\n\n\nAnother example of regularization is the use of smoothing techniques in data fitting and interpolation. When fitting a curve to a set of data points, it is often desirable to find a curve that is smooth and does not oscillate too much between points. By adding a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes the curvature or complexity of the curve, we can encourage the optimization algorithm to find a smoother curve that fits the data better.\n\n\n\nRegularization is a useful tool in many areas of mathematics, including machine learning, optimization, and signal processing, and it can help to improve the accuracy and stability of mathematical models.']","['Bayesian statistics reference', 'Specific examples mentioned', 'In-depth explanation']","['Optimization problem focus', ""Use of layman's terms"", 'Real world examples', 'Smoothing techniques mention']"
"Please explain what is ""Radar imaging""","['Imaging radar is an application of radar which is used to create two-dimensional images, typically of landscapes. Imaging radar provides its light to illuminate an area on the ground and take a picture at radio wavelengths. It uses an antenna and digital computer storage to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the energy that was reflected back towards the radar antenna. The radar moves along a flight path and the area illuminated by the radar, or footprint, is moved along the surface in a swath, building the image as it does so.\nDigital radar images are composed of many dots.  Each pixel in the radar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground: brighter areas represent high backscatter, darker areas represents low backscatter.\nThe traditional application of radar is to display the position and motion of typically highly reflective objects (such as aircraft or ships) by sending out a radiowave signal, and then detecting the direction and delay of the reflected signal. Imaging radar on the other hand attempts to form an image of one object (e.g. a landscape) by furthermore registering the intensity of the reflected signal to determine the amount of scattering (cf. Light scattering). The registered electromagnetic scattering is then mapped onto a two-dimensional plane, with points with a higher reflectivity getting assigned usually a brighter color, thus creating an image.\nSeveral techniques have evolved to do this. Generally they take advantage of the Doppler effect caused by the rotation or other motion of the object and by the changing view of the object brought about by the relative motion between the object and the back-scatter that is perceived by the radar of the object (typically, a plane) flying over the earth. Through recent improvements of the techniques, radar imaging is getting more accurate. Imaging radar has been used to map the Earth, other planets, asteroids, other celestial objects and to categorize targets for military systems.']","['Radar imaging is a technique used to create images or maps of objects or surfaces using radar.

The strength and timing of the reflection is used to determine the distance, size, and shape of the object. By repeating this process multiple times and collecting data from different angles, a radar system can create an image or map of the object or surface.\n\n\n\nRadar imaging has a number of applications, including remote sensing, weather forecasting, aviation, and military surveillance.

"Please explain what is ""White-box testing""","['White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system is used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).\nWhite-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system–level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Where white-box testing is design-driven, that is, driven exclusively by agreed specifications of how each component of software is required to behave (as in DO-178C and ISO 26262 processes), white-box test techniques can accomplish assessment for unimplemented or missing requirements.\nWhite-box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:']","['White-box testing is a method of testing software in which the tester has complete knowledge of the internal workings and structure of the system being tested.

It is often used in combination with black-box testing to provide a comprehensive testing strategy.\n\n\n\nTo perform white-box testing, the tester needs to have a detailed understanding of the code being tested and the algorithms and processes it uses. The tester will create test cases that exercise different parts of the code and verify that the output is correct.

The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection.[10] The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm[10] and can be calculated as (1 − specificity). The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from \n\n\n\n−\n∞\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -\\infty }\n\n to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.\nROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution.
