I’m trying to understand the behavior of different language models. The above are some descriptions of model outputs, and I'd like to cluster them into different axes of variation. Using these specific examples, are there any general patterns, clusters, or variations you notice in the descriptions? Try to give patterns that are specific enough that someone could reliably produce new examples that fit the rule, and that they could understand what it means to be higher or lower on that specific axis. Please make the axes such that no two axes will provide roughly the same takeaways about the data. Please try to give as
many general patterns as possible. Please focus on patterns that are important for understanding the behavior of a language model, as these will later be used to help debug an important system. Please explain clearly why the pattern would be important for understanding the behavior of such a system. Please summarize as many as you can and stick to the examples. Please output your response as a numbered list.","1. **Level of Detail**: This axis ranges from detailed descriptions such as 'detailed historical elements', 'mention of specific techniques', and 'variety of AI forms', to concise outputs such as 'brevity in response', 'less detail', and 'concise explanation'. Understanding this pattern is crucial to grasp how the language model processes and represents information. A system that provides overly detailed answers might overwhelm or confuse a user, while a system that heavily simplifies information risks omitting important details. 

2. **Contextual Nature**: The axis includes references to the context such as 'psychological context', 'business and practical applications', 'historical context', 'scientific context', and 'academic tone'. Insights gained from this axis help guide the model's understanding and usage of real-world context in its outputs, which is essential for providing accurate and resonating responses.

3. **Technicality of Language**: This axis ranges from simple language wording like 'plain language explanations', 'simple language', and 'simple examples', to complex or specialized language such as 'scientific terminology', 'technical jargon', and 'technical language/terms'. This will be key for understanding a system's behavior in order to adapt it to different user groups and their preferences or needs.

4. **Functional Explanation**: This includes 'direct application scenario', 'explanatory format', 'function and methods description', etc. This pattern explains how diligently the model describes the functionalities, process, or application scenarios, helping us determine how well the model can clarify or elaborate complex processes and ideas.

5. **Academic Affiliation and References**: This involves 'emphasis on academic credentials', 'academic tone', 'research references', 'academic honors and affiliations'. This pattern underscores the capacity of the model to incorporate authoritative and validated sources. Understanding this behavior would be pivotal in assessing the credibility and reliability of the model's outputs.

6. **Practical Application and Scenario**: Certain descriptions suggest actual use cases or scenarios like 'practical application mention', 'real-world examples', 'specific use-cases of concept'. Thorough understanding of this pattern can give insight into how widely and accurately the language model can apply learned information, contributing to system debugging and usability improvement.

7. **Explanation and Elaboration**: This is found in descriptions like 'step-by-step explanation', 'definition elaboration', 'detailed explanations'. This axis can help assess the model's capability for didactic and explanatory content.

8. **Mention of Specific Techniques and Concepts**: This axis includes 'mention of ai techniques', 'mention of obsolescence', 'mention of radical breakthroughs'. The pattern helps determine how adept the model is at addressing and elaborating on varied techniques and concepts.

9. **Use of Metaphors and Analogies**: 'human learning analogy', 'usage of metaphor (images)'. This aspect is key in understanding the language model's ability to simplify complex ideas through metaphors, an important factor for comprehensibility and user-friendliness. 

10. **Directness of Response**: This involves 'direct response', 'direct application scenario', 'direct definition'. This pattern clarifies how the model responds to a prompt; it can be crucial for ensuring the productivity and relevancy of model’s response.

Each of these patterns/axes is significant for understanding the language model's behavior, and by extension, its strengths and limitations. Gaining insight into these behaviors is critical to effectively debug the system and refine its performance."
Level of Detail,"Thank you. Now I would like you to use these axes to categorize the specific examples I gave you. To start with, let's consider this axis you chose:
1. **Level of Detail**: This axis ranges from detailed descriptions such as 'detailed historical elements', 'mention of specific techniques', and 'variety of AI forms', to concise outputs such as 'brevity in response', 'less detail', and 'concise explanation'. Understanding this pattern is crucial to grasp how the language model processes and represents information. A system that provides overly detailed answers might overwhelm or confuse a user, while a system that heavily simplifies information risks omitting important details. 

I want you to provide a description of each end of this axis then I want you to consider each of the specific descriptions from before, and determine whether they are relevant to this axis. If they are, say how they score along this axis on a scale of -5 to 5, where -5 means they are strongly towards the low end of the axis, and 5 means they are strongly towards the high end. Provide your output as a tuple of each end of the axis and then list of descriptions followed by the score, each on one line, such as
Axis descriptions: (""{description of low end}"", ""{description of high end}"")
1. ""{first description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
2. ""{second description}"": {score from -5 to 5}

Functional Explanation,"Thank you. Now I would like you to use these axes to categorize the specific examples I gave you. To start with, let's consider this axis you chose:
4. **Functional Explanation**: This includes 'direct application scenario', 'explanatory format', 'function and methods description', etc. This pattern explains how diligently the model describes the functionalities, process, or application scenarios, helping us determine how well the model can clarify or elaborate complex processes and ideas.

I want you to provide a description of each end of this axis then I want you to consider each of the specific descriptions from before, and determine whether they are relevant to this axis. If they are, say how they score along this axis on a scale of -5 to 5, where -5 means they are strongly towards the low end of the axis, and 5 means they are strongly towards the high end. Provide your output as a tuple of each end of the axis and then list of descriptions followed by the score, each on one line, such as
Axis descriptions: (""{description of low end}"", ""{description of high end}"")
1. ""{first description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
2. ""{second description}"": {score from -5 to 5}

Academic Affiliation and References,"Thank you. Now I would like you to use these axes to categorize the specific examples I gave you. To start with, let's consider this axis you chose:
5. **Academic Affiliation and References**: This involves 'emphasis on academic credentials', 'academic tone', 'research references', 'academic honors and affiliations'. This pattern underscores the capacity of the model to incorporate authoritative and validated sources. Understanding this behavior would be pivotal in assessing the credibility and reliability of the model's outputs.

I want you to provide a description of each end of this axis then I want you to consider each of the specific descriptions from before, and determine whether they are relevant to this axis. If they are, say how they score along this axis on a scale of -5 to 5, where -5 means they are strongly towards the low end of the axis, and 5 means they are strongly towards the high end. Provide your output as a tuple of each end of the axis and then list of descriptions followed by the score, each on one line, such as

6. **Practical Application and Scenario**: Certain descriptions suggest actual use cases or scenarios like 'practical application mention', 'real-world examples', 'specific use-cases of concept'. Thorough understanding of this pattern can give insight into how widely and accurately the language model can apply learned information, contributing to system debugging and usability improvement.

I want you to provide a description of each end of this axis then I want you to consider each of the specific descriptions from before, and determine whether they are relevant to this axis. If they are, say how they score along this axis on a scale of -5 to 5, where -5 means they are strongly towards the low end of the axis, and 5 means they are strongly towards the high end. Provide your output as a tuple of each end of the axis and then list of descriptions followed by the score, each on one line, such as
Axis descriptions: (""{description of low end}"", ""{description of high end}"")
1. ""{first description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
2. ""{second description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
Include only the descriptions that are relevant to the axis. As a reminder, here are the descriptions from before:

Use of Metaphors and Analogies,"Thank you. Now I would like you to use these axes to categorize the specific examples I gave you. To start with, let's consider this axis you chose:
9. **Use of Metaphors and Analogies**: 'human learning analogy', 'usage of metaphor (images)'. This aspect is key in understanding the language model's ability to simplify complex ideas through metaphors, an important factor for comprehensibility and user-friendliness. 

I want you to provide a description of each end of this axis then I want you to consider each of the specific descriptions from before, and determine whether they are relevant to this axis. If they are, say how they score along this axis on a scale of -5 to 5, where -5 means they are strongly towards the low end of the axis, and 5 means they are strongly towards the high end. Provide your output as a tuple of each end of the axis and then list of descriptions followed by the score, each on one line, such as
Axis descriptions: (""{description of low end}"", ""{description of high end}"")
1. ""{first description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
2. ""{second description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
Include only the descriptions that are relevant to the axis. As a reminder, here are the descriptions from before:
[
psychological context
detailed historical elements
mention of specific techniques
direct application scenarios

Please output your response as a tuple of axis descriptions on the first lines, and the following lines as a numbered list of the decriptions and their score. Please ensure the descriptions of each end of the axis are clear, distinct from each other, and under 5 words.
","Axis descriptions: (""Low use of metaphors and analogies"", ""High use of metaphors and analogies"")

1. ""usage of metaphor (images)"": 5
2. ""human learning analogy"": 4
3. ""explanation of modularity concept"": 2
4. ""potential tool references"": 1
5. ""explanatory continuity"": 0
6. ""description of win conditions"": -1
7. ""direct definition"": -2
8. ""specific terminology use"": -4
9. ""direct quoting of sources"": -5 

Here, a higher score represents high usage and skillful implementation of metaphors and analogies in the given context, while lower scores indicate direct, straightforward language without much reliance on such figurative language tools."
Directness of Response,"Thank you. Now I would like you to use these axes to categorize the specific examples I gave you. To start with, let's consider this axis you chose:
10. **Directness of Response**: This involves 'direct response', 'direct application scenario', 'direct definition'. This pattern clarifies how the model responds to a prompt; it can be crucial for ensuring the productivity and relevancy of model’s response.

I want you to provide a description of each end of this axis then I want you to consider each of the specific descriptions from before, and determine whether they are relevant to this axis. If they are, say how they score along this axis on a scale of -5 to 5, where -5 means they are strongly towards the low end of the axis, and 5 means they are strongly towards the high end. Provide your output as a tuple of each end of the axis and then list of descriptions followed by the score, each on one line, such as
Axis descriptions: (""{description of low end}"", ""{description of high end}"")
1. ""{first description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
2. ""{second description}"": {score from -5 to 5}
Include only the descriptions that are relevant to the axis. As a reminder, here are the descriptions from before:
